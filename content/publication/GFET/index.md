abstract: >
  In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a need for reliable diagnostic testing. However, state-of-the-art detection methods rely on laboratory tests and also vary in accuracy. We evaluate that the usage of a graphene field-effect-transistor (GFET) coupled with machine learning can be a promising alternate diagnostic testing method. We processed the current-voltage data gathered from the GFET sensors to assess information about the presence of COVID-19 in biosamples. We perform binary classification using the following machine learning algorithms: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machines (SVM) with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in conjunction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We find that LDA and SVM with RBF proved to be the most accurate in identifying positive and negative samples, with accuracies of 99\% and 98.5\%, respectively. Based on these results, there is promise to develop a bioelectronic diagnostic method for COVID-19 detection by combining GFET technology with machine learning.
