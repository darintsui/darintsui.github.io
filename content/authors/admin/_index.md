Hi there! My name is Darin. I'm an incoming Ph.D. student at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. I previously received my BS degree at the University of California San Diego in Bioengineering. <br><br>

I am currently working on developing artificial intelligence solutions in applications of bioinformatics with Dr. <a href="https://amirmohan.github.io/">Amirali Aghazadeh</a>. In my undergrad, I was designing a low-cost surgical navigation platform using computer vision under Dr. Frank Talke in the <a href="https://www.talkelab.ucsd.edu/">Talke Biomedical Device Lab</a>. I have also explored applications of machine learning in bioelectronic COVID-19 detection under Dr. Gert Cauwenberghs
in the <a href="https://isn.ucsd.edu/index.php">Integrated Systems Neuroengineering Laboratory</a>. <br><br>

Outside of research, I was the 2022-2023 President of the <a href="https://ieeeucsd.org/">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 
(IEEE) student branch</a> at UC San Diego. I am an active IEEE member as well as a member of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS).
